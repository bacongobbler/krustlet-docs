Krustlet has a lot of documentation. A high-level overview of how it’s organized
will help you know where to look for certain things:

- [The introduction](/intro/) takes you by the hand through a series of
  steps to run an application on Krustlet. Start here if you’re new to Krustlet.
- [Topic guides](/topics/) discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly
  high level and provide useful background information and explanation.
- [Community Guides](/community/) teach you about the development
  process for Krustlet and how you can contribute to the project.
- [How To Guides](/howto/) are recipes. They guide you through the steps
  involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than
  tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Krustlet works.
